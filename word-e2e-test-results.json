The document title is essential for accessibility as it helps screen reader users identify the document and is typically the first piece of information announced when opening the PDF.\n\n## Step-by-Step Fix\n\n1. Open the PDF in Adobe Acrobat Pro.\n\n2. Go to **File** > **Properties** (or press Ctrl+D / Command+D).\n\n3. In the Document Properties dialog box, click on the **Description** tab.\n\n4. In the **Title** field, enter a descriptive title for your document (e.g., \"Course Syllabus for [Course Name]\").\n\n5. While in the Properties dialog, check the **Initial View** tab.\n\n6. Under \"Show\" section, find \"Show\" dropdown for \"Document Title\" and select **Document Title** instead of \"File Name\" to ensure screen readers announce the title.\n\n7. Click **OK** to save the changes.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Go back to **File** > **Properties** to confirm the title appears in the Description tab.\n\n2. Open the document and check that the title appears in the title bar of Acrobat (if you selected \"Document Title\" in the Initial View settings).\n\n3.

You'll likely see mostly `<P>` (paragraph) tags without proper heading hierarchy\n\n3. **Identify heading content**:\n   - Review your document to identify text that should be headings (title, section headers, subsection headers)\n   - Plan a logical heading hierarchy (H1 for document title, H2 for main sections, H3 for subsections, etc.)\n\n4. **Add heading tags**:\n   - For each piece of text that should be a heading:\n     a. Right-click on the corresponding tag in the Tags panel\n     b. Select \"Properties\"\n     c. Change the \"Type\" from `<P>` to the appropriate heading level (`<H1>`, `<H2>`, etc.)\n     d. Click \"Close\"\n\n5. **Alternative method using Reading Order tool**:\n   - Click on \"Accessibility\" in the right panel\n   - Select \"Reading Order\" tool\n   - Draw a box around text that should be a heading\n   - Click the appropriate heading button (Heading 1, Heading 2, etc.) in the Reading Order dialog\n   - Repeat for all headings in the document\n\n6. **Ensure proper nesting**:\n   - Make sure heading levels are used in proper order (H1, then H2, then H3)\n   - Don't skip levels (e.g., don't go from H1 directly to H3)\n\n# Verification\nTo verify your fix worked:\n- Use the Tags panel to confirm heading tags (`<H1>`, `<H2>`, etc.) are present and in logical order\n- Use the Navigation panel (View > Show/Hide > Navigation Panes > Bookmarks) to see if headings appear as navigable bookmarks\n- Try navigating the document using heading shortcuts in a screen reader (if available)\n- Check that the heading structure makes logical sense for the document's content organization",
